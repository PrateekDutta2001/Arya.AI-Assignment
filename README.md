# Arya.AI-Assignment

This is the Assignment for the post of Data Scientist at Arya.AI Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India

Objective - To carry out binary classification on provided data

General Approach

> Data collection

> Data preprocessing

> Feature engineering

> Scaling/Normalization

> Model selection

> Training

> Validation

> Testing

> Deployment

**Thought process -**

1. Load the training dataset from csv file and figure out what kind of information is present in it.

2. Divide the dataset in features and classes dataframe

3. Check for missing data and handle it

4. Perform EDA

5. Find out the correlation between multiple features present in dataset

6. Feature selection using suitable technique

7. Scaling/Normalization of training data

8. Dimension reduction if required

9. Selection of classifier

10. Training and cross validation of classifier

11. Performance metrics of trained model

12. Prediction on test dataset

13. Pipeline

First run 'feature_selection.ipynb' notebook to check whether some features are needed to be removed
To check if dimension reduction is required or not run 'dimension_reduction.ipynb' notebook
Finally, to carry out complete machine learning pipeline run 'complete_pipeline.ipynb' notebook
After successful execution of above steps 'output.csv' file will be generated with predictions on test dataset

**Requirements**

Python Version >= 3.7
Python Library information is available in 'requirements.txt'
